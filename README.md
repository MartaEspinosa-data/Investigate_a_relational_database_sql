The Sakila Database contains movie rental data, which was queried to analyze customer behavior and payment earnings across different customer groups, as well as store performance.

The four questions of interest are:

What are the most successful categories among the family movies ? 
What is the distribution of family-friendly movies among the film categories and rental duration categories ?
How does the two stores compare in their count of rental orders ?
Who are the top 10 paying customers ? How many did each paid in total ?
